# Business Setup
Launch your Pros on the Shortcut platform.

# **Premier tech for your Business**

Through your Shortcut Business Account, you can register new Pros, manage their settings, and service your clients.

Use the Sandbox apps to test Pro registration, Pro onboarding/scheduling, client booking and notifications, in a test environment where payments will not be charged. We have specific apps to use for Sandbox testing. NOTE: Any Pros created with test accounts will not appear in the live production Shortcut app.

To get in touch with Shortcut, please reach out to support@getshortcut.co.
